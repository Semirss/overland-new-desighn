September 11th is both New Year's Day and the Feast of Saint John the Baptist. The day is called Enkutatash meaning the 'Gift of Jewels.' When the famous Queen of Sheba returned from her expensive jaunt to visit King Solomon in Jerusalem, her chiefs welcomed her back by replenishing her treasury with Enku or Jewels. The spring festival has been celebrated since these early times and as the rains come to their abrupt end, dancing and singing can be heard at every village in the green countryside, after dark on New Year's Eve people light bonfires outside their houses."

The word actually means 'cross' and the feast commemorates the discovery of the cross upon, which Jesus was crucified, by the Empress Helena, the mother of Constantine the Great. The original event took place on 19 March 326 AD, but the feast is now celebrated on 27th of September. Many of the rites observed throughout the festival are said to be directly connected to the legend of Empress Helena. On the eve of Maskel, tall branches are tied together and yellow daisies, popularly called Meskel flowers, are placed at the top. During the night, these branches are gathered together in front of the compound gates and ignited. This symbolizes the actions of the Empress whom, when no one would show her the Holy Sepulcher, lit incense and prayed for help. Where the smoke drifted, she dug and found three crosses, to one of them, the True Cross, many miracles were attributed. During this time of year flowers bloom on the mountains and plains and the meadows are yellow with the brilliant Meskel daisy. Dancing, feasting, merrymaking, bonfires, and even gun salutes mark the occasion. The festival begins by planting a green tree on Meskel Eve in town squares and village marketplaces. Everyone brings a pole topped with Meskel daisies to form the towering pyramid that will soon be a beacon of flame. Torches of eucalyptus twigs called chibo are used to light the bundle of branches called Demera. In Addis Ababa celebrations start in the early afternoon, when a huge procession bearing flaming torches approaches Meskel Square from various directions. The marchers include priests in their brightly hued vestments, students, brass bands, contingents of the armed forces, and bedecked floats carrying huge lit crosses. They circle the Demera and fling their torches upon it, while singing a special Meskel song. Thousands gather at the square to join in and welcome the season of flowers and golden sunshine called Tseday. As evening darkens, the flames glow brighter. It is not until dawn that the burning pyramid consumes itself and the big tree at the centre finally falls. During the celebrations, each house is stocked with tella, the local beer, and strangers are made welcome."

Emperor Menelik II founded Addis Ababa as a capital city in 1887; this big, sprawling, hospitable city still bears the stamp of his exuberant personality. Covering more than 540 square kilometers, Addis Ababa is situated at the foothills of the 3,200-meter Entoto Mountains, and rambles pleasantly across many wooded hillsides and gullies cut with fast-flowing streams. Wide tree-lined streets, fine architecture, glorious weather, and the incongruity of donkey trains along the boulevards make Addis a city of surprises and a delightful place to explore. The clear mountain air gives the city the bracing atmosphere of a summer highland resort. It enjoys a mild climate, with altitudes ranging from 2,200 to 2,500 meters above sea level and an average temperature of 61°F. Addis Ababa, which literally means 'New Flower,' stands at the very heart of Ethiopia, with much to see and do. The city has a flourishing cultural life, with regular exhibitions and lectures. There are many opportunities to experience Ethiopian music, songs, and dance, to visit museums, and to explore the city’s many sights."

Unlike the Lalibela churches, Tigrai's rock churches are often excavated directly from vertical cliffs, sometimes with ledges and false entrances. Dating from the 4th to the 15th century, under emperors Abreha and Atsebeha, these churches lie along the Mekelle–Adigrat road and are grouped into clusters: Gheralta, Atsbi Wonberta, Wukro, Tsada Imba [Teka Tesfai], as well as the monasteries of Debre Damo and Gunda Gundo, with some accessible from main roads and others requiring mountain climbs and off-road travel.",

An Arizona, however, without motels or desperadoes, but nevertheless an eldorado with the choice intellectual pleasure of constantly stimulating and satisfying the passion for discovery. It is the home of a quarter of the rock churches, some famous for their stone workmanship, ancient paintings and manuscripts, and others known for their magnificent view and difficult ascent.

            "description": "The largest rock-hewn church in Tigray, known for its impressive architecture and ancient frescoes. Abune Yemata is one of Gheralta's rock hewn churches, it can be reached from the historic town of Hawzien, turning off at the village of Megab and keeping left on the escarpment. A 4km drive from Megab and a further 30 minutes' walk will bring you to the foot of the perpendicular rock mountains of Guh. The scenery is breathtaking and the mountains resemble pillars reaching to the sky. Megab is only 10 km from Degum or 8 km south of Hawzen. This church is carved on the cliff face of the Guh Mountains; unfortunately, there are no ropes, like at Debre Damo used to ascent. You can find only footholds and handgrips in the rock face. Just before the entrance to the church there is a narrow ledge carved in the cliff from which one can view a sheer drop of approximately 250m to 300m. Ivy Pearce, one of the first few westerners to visit the site, gives her account of a visit: \"I climbed up some pretty stiff stuff and then came face to face with a cliff face with only footholds and handgrips at irregular intervals. This climb I could not manage, as my arms were not long enough to reach the next handgrip to let my foot go to find the next foot-grip. Furthermore, the handgrips were too wide to grasp firmly with my small hands. I didn't want to take risks, so gave it up and sat on a small ledge below.\" Ruth Plant on her part described the church as \"...the most unusual church in the most unusual place, that place being majestic and awesome.\" The effort of ascending, however, is lavishly rewarded by the well-preserved paintings attributed to the 15th century. The interior of the church has four free standing and six non-free standing columns. It is 7.8m wide, 9.4m deep and 4m high. In fact, the church is not only known for its difficult ascent but also for its truly remarkable murals. It is colorfully decorated wall to wall with exciting murals of Old and New Testament stories. Nine of the twelve apostles are depicted in a round frame on the ceiling. Abune Yemata on his horseback is shown on one of the walls. Plant described the paintings as \"the most sophisticated paintings found so far in Tigrai.\" It is indeed surprising to learn that such great works of art existed for centuries in an \"unusual place\" that seems rather closer to the moon than to earth. And it stands to reason that the so-called \"enemies of the church\" failed to reach it or never knew it existed. It is interesting to witness people from all lifestyles climb the church \"like spiders\" on the annual festival which takes place on November 8 in most years."

An hour's climb from the village brings you to the church. Daniel Korkor, a smaller rock church, is a minutes' walk apart. While climbing up to the church, a visitor enjoys the panoramic view of the Hawzien plain to the northeast and Imbasneity to the west. The church of Mariam Korkor faces west and it has a white washed façade of a built structure. It is one of the biggest and most complex rock-hewn churches of Tigrai. The interior of the church is 9.4m wide, 17m deep and about 6m high. There are six huge pillars, 2.4m apart from one another. The columns have bracket capitals and are cruciform in design. There are also a series of beautifully decorated arches, the arches and ceiling of the church are decorated with bas-reliefs, some of them similar to those at Abraha Atsebaha. Mariam Korkor is also rich in terms of ancient murals, the walls and columns of the church are decorated with paintings of stories from both the Old and New Testament. On one of the columns, a magnificent painting depicting Archangel Raphael can be viewed. This particular painting is reported by Gerster to be \"similar to the painting in the cathedral church of Faras.\" Another painting on the western wall is of the Virgin Mary with a circle around her abdomen. This circle, according to Ivy Pearce, indicates the development of Christ in utero. She further went on to state that such a theme was common in the 17th century Byzantine art. Plant observed variations in the styles of the paintings in the church and was led to believe that \"at least three painters have been at work.\" The church also has a wide collection of parchment manuscripts and crosses. Daniel Korkor is a smaller church with only two rooms. The ceiling of the domed anteroom is decorated with primitive paintings. The mountains of Gheralta and the Hawzien plain can be viewed along the route to Daniel Korkor."

            "description": "This stunning church, often referred to as Abune Abraham after the monk who founded it, Debre Tsion is a church entirely hewn from a living rock. It is rectangular in shape, 12.9m deep, 7.7m wide and 7.6m high. Its ceiling is supported by six cruciform pillars and its three sides are surrounded by a cloister. The back walls of the holy of holies, the domes and the wall panels are abundantly decorated with fine paintings of saints and apostles. The dome is especially adorned with patterns. \"When we did enter we were astonished at the beauty of this church and its many murals,\" reports Ivy Pearce. Because of the simplicity of the lines and colors, the paintings are estimated to be of the 15th century, although according to historians the church itself is thought to have been constructed in the 14th century. Even though it is amazing to learn that the paintings have survived to this day without receiving due care and protection, their color is now fading at an alarming rate due to water seepage. A 15th century unique circular ceremonial fan, one meter in diameter with wooden framework, makes the visit to this church special. Each of its 34 panels is finely painted with figures of the apostles. There is also a small domed room considered to have served as Abune Abraham's prayer room. Its walls are decorated with many geometrical designs and carvings in relief depicting Angels and Saints. It is indeed a manifestation of the great stone workmanship that was prevalent in the whole of Tigrai both at that time and before. According to Ruth Plant, it is \"one of the great churches of Tigrai, both from the architectural and devotional aspect.\" The annual festival takes place on the 21st of Hidar (30th of November in most years)."

David Buxton reports, \"This church of Saint John, is the most interesting I have seen and is memorable, too, for its means of access which is a narrow clef between bulging walls of bare, glaring sandstone.\" It is an hour's walk from Debretsion. There are two entrance doors, both depicting Aksumite style of construction. The main entrance is for men while the secondary entrance, which lies to the right of the main entrance, is for women. The sanctuary is so bright because of the abundant light that comes in through the window above the main entrance. The church has a rectangular shape and its inside space measures about 13m deep and 10m wide. The height of the walls is about six meters. There are four freestanding pillars supporting the ceiling. According to Ruth Plant, the general layout of the church is different from that of the other rock churches. \"If I thought that the other churches had a reverent and holy atmosphere, this one more so,\" writes Ivy Pearce. Plant adds, \"So sacred did this church seem to be that while we were inside taking many flash pictures of the screws of murals on the walls, we were talking to one another very quietly.\" Yohannes Maequddi is best known for its ancient and well-preserved paintings. Ruth Plant referred to them as \"strangely pleasing primitive paintings.\" Ivy Pearce, in agreement with Plant, adds, \"The church of Yohannes Maequddi in the Gheralta region of Tigrai has crude and quite primitive paintings, quaint and attractive, different from any other church in Tigrai.\" They are in very good condition because of the nonporous nature of the rock upon which they are painted. Among the many subjects these old magnificent paintings depict are Adam, Eve, a serpent, Apostle John, and Madonna and Child. Dale Otto, one of the members of Pearce's pilgrimage to the rock-hewn churches of Tigrai, remarks, \"Their flatness, simplicity, boldness of line, lack of shading and richness of color are unique among the churches we visited. Even their occasional geometrically patterned borders are wide, have flat colors and lack the intricacy of similar designs in other churches and manuscripts.\""

The way to the sanctuary is itself memorable. The path is a steep climb and passes through a split, which requires jumping to and from rocks. The interior part of the church is abundantly decorated with marvelous paintings and murals. Irrespective of its difficult ascent, the church has a wealth of murals."

            "description": "A visit to Gheralta should also include Inda Mariam Wukro. This relic rock-hewn church is situated near a Nebelet settlement and found 34 km from the town of Hawzien. The church of Mariam Wukro is not separated from the native rock. Its visible southern exterior does not give any indication of the quality of the interior. Instead, it could be said that the exterior almost obliterates the great ornamentation and workmanship displayed throughout the interior of the church. Regarding this aspect, Ruth Plant comments: \"In the overgrown churchyard with tall bamboo canes, the natural rock face, with two doors and two rough windows, gives no anticipation of the accurately carved interior.\" The exterior, like that of many others, has a completely alien leer indeed. In Tigrean tradition of rock church architecture, the concern is the interior and almost no effort is exerted in beautifying the exterior. In confirmation of this fact, Paul Henze writes, \"There is almost no interest in the exterior in Tigrai ... but the interiors of the larger Tigrean rock churches are superior to most of those of Lalibela in refinement of design and decoration.\" In fact, there are three doors on the southern facade of the church, two directly leading to the sanctuary and one leading to the inner circuit of the church (the kine Mahlet). The kine Mahlet, 9.2m deep, 4.4m wide and 5.2m high, are richly decorated with stone carvings and relatively recent paintings. Its wall panels and ceiling are splendidly ornamented. Finely incised large Greek crosses dominate the western and southern sides of the ceiling while its northern and central parts are adorned by geometrically perfect domes. Two superbly carved freestanding columns, whose height is 3.3m, support the ceiling and divide the narthex into two bays. The columns are connected by a double arch with an unsupported median pendant. It is a remarkable sight. A wooden door leads from the kine Mahlet to the Sanctuary. Another entrance grants access from the ambulatory (immediate church enclosure) on the northwestern side of the church to the three-bayed and three-aisled sanctuary. It is more than 9m wide and 10m deep. Its nine-meter high ceiling is supported by four colossal freestanding columns with bracket capitals. There are also ten columns in bas-relief. The huge columns, the exceptionally high ceiling, as well as the series of arches, domes and decorative crosses in relief are sources of its unmatched grace and unusual aura of sacredness. On the western side of the holy of holies, one can see a window-like opening in Aksumite style. It is very much reminiscent of the windows of Lalibela churches. In fact, in many respects, the church itself shows considerable resemblance to the churches of Lalibela and Debre Damo. David Buxton writes, \"Enda Mariam Wukro shows clear kinship with the built church at Debre Damo with some important Lalibela churches including Mariam, Amanuel, and Abba Libanos.\" Another chapel, accessible by a wooden ladder, houses the tabot of Saint George. It is, in fact, an extension of the church of Mariam. Inda Mariam Wukro is a very complex and magnificent church. According to Ruth Plant, it is \"without doubt a great example of Tigrean architecture.\" Professor Antonio Mordini was probably the first foreigner to visit this sacred edifice of worship in 1939."

This church is carved from the top of an isolated and roughly round rock hill. Despite its dimensions, it is rather easy to reach, and one of the least visited relics in the region. From the top of the hill, one can enjoy a commanding view of the mountain of Tserae and the valley of Womberta to the southeast. There are a number of graves and a few dwellings inside the churchyard. The church has a built facade, which, according to the chief priest, was built in 1967. Two entrances lead from the anteroom to the sanctuary. It is a three-aisled and three-bayed square church, 9m wide and 9m deep. It has twelve columns, four of them freestanding and cruciform in design. The bracket capitals at different heights and the domes and altars are skillfully executed. The ceiling is decorated with a variety of patterns in relief. Mikael Barka is not known for its wealth of paintings, but one can see murals depicting Saint Mikael. There are also faded murals visible on several columns. Tradition has it that the church was burnt by Queen Judith in the tenth century. According to oral tradition, the edifice is believed to have been sculpted in the 6th century under the auspices of Abune Abraham, an Ethiopian saint."

            "description": "The church of Debre Selam Mikael is situated 9 km northwest of the town of Atsbi. It is situated inside a mountainside cave, however noticeable due to its white washed facade. The mountain is 2678 meters above sea level. The view from the top of the green meadows below and of the running river Hidar at the foot of the hill is exhilarating. There are three wooden doors and four square wooden windows on the white washed facade of the outer church. The arched door, just beyond the entrance to the churchyard, is 2.3m high and one meter across. A looped cross and a carved Greek cross can be seen on the window shutters. The exterior of the church is 11.6m in width, 11.5m in depth and 5m in height. The church is unique in its architectural design. It is a church within a cave or, as Ivy Pearce referred to it, \"a church within a church.\" Ruth Plant, the author of the book entitled The Architecture of the Tigrai, reported that it is \"a combination of built front, rock roof and sides.\" The central door leads into the anteroom with three huge built columns, a beautiful freestanding arch and a water catchment basin. It is built in the Aksumite \"sandwich style\" of construction (a layer of wood then a layer of stone). The woodwork of the doors and window shutters is exquisitely decorated in geometrical patterns and includes swastika-like symbols. The window shutters above the central door are especially ornately carved. A lovely painting of the Madonna and Child can also be seen on one of the window shutters. The ends of the protruding part of the wood beams are round in shape and their presence adds beauty to the church. The area where the sanctuary and the Holy of Holies lie are small and dark due to daylight being almost completely excluded by the window shutters. It is 6m in width, 6.5m in depth and 7m in height and has four freestanding pillars about 2.6m tall. The series of arches of stone are tastefully executed. Except for its limited space and darkness, the church is regarded as one of the finest. Ivy Pearce described the church as \"one of the most extraordinary\" edifices of Tigrai whose \"design and workmanship is of the highest order.\" The church of Debre Selam Mikael is also known for its wealth of paintings. Many faded murals can be seen on the walls and arches of the sanctuary. The art influence, according to Pearce, is Byzantine."

            "description": "Mikael Imba can be reached either from Wukro via Atsbi or Agulae. It is only 35 km from Mekelle, via the small town of Haiki Meshal. The church is dedicated to Saint Mikael and lies on a flat-topped hill, 2300m above sea level. It is not visible until one reaches the top of the hill. The beautiful track from Atsbi leads to within a few meters of the foot of the hill. Swiss photographer George Gerster comments, \"I do not know of any trip in Ethiopia of greater attraction with regard to the countryside. The Amba in question offers a view of paradise.\" The church is almost a monolith and three of its walls are completely free of the cliff out of which it is carved. The exterior of the church is about 17m wide. The central entrance leads into the anteroom beyond, the beautifully decorated wooden door that leads to the sanctuary. The interior decoration of the church is impressive. \"Internally one is astonished, as at Abraha Atsebaha, by the complexities of the design and the skill displayed in achieving such a layout by the difficult and laborious process of excavation,\" comments David Buxton, the entomologist who studied the rock-hewn churches of Tigrai. Dr. Tewelde Medhin Yosef, the first to list the rock-hewn churches of Tigrai, described it \"as an artistically finished church.\" The church's ceiling, like that of Wukro Cherkos, is geometrically patterned. Stepped capitals and a large Greek cross hewn in relief on the ceiling can also be seen. The walls have many carvings and the wooden doors are beautifully decorated. Dale Otto, a member of Pearce’s pilgrimage to the rock-hewn churches of Tigrai, remarks, \"This church is magnificent inside, a masterpiece of stone hewing. Throughout this church the workmanship and symmetry are of the highest standard.\" The church of Mikael Imba is spacious, 16.6m wide and 9m deep (excluding the Holy of Holies area and the anteroom). There are nine freestanding and sixteen pillars in relief. The pillars are 3.2m tall and 2.5m apart. The ceiling is 6m high. Mikael Imba is one of the painstakingly carved and complex churches of Tigrai. Mikael Imba is also one of the wealthiest churches in terms of treasures and manuscripts. The 1.5m tall black iron cross which, according to Pearce, was made \"at a time when iron was much more precious than gold and silver,\" is one of the valuable possessions of the church. Many manuscripts (some partially damaged by accidental fire) can be seen in the treasure house of the church. Pearce, after her pilgrimage to the rock churches of Tigrai, wrote about one of the manuscripts, \"The entire manuscript was decorated page by page in its letters very like The Book of the Kells and Lindisfarne Gospels.\" No academic authority has established with certainty the exact date of construction of this splendid edifice. Tradition has it that it was built in the 4th century AD. David Buxton is of the opinion that Wukro Cherkos, Mikael Imba and Abraha Atsebaha are \"posterior to Debre Damo\" but \"before Lalibela\" (late 11th or early 12th century). The existence of Mikael Imba was first reported in 1948 by Beatrice Playne, the pioneer in the study of Ethiopian paintings. On either side of the church there are large water catchment basins, similar to those of the Debre Damo monastery. According to the priests of the church, the water remains at a constant level. The annual festival takes place on the 12th day of Hidar (21st of November in most years)."

The church is almost a monolith with the exception of its eastern side. In many aspects, the edifice shows a considerable resemblance to the Abraha Atsebaha and Mikael Imba churches; all have a cruciform plan and share Aksumite architectural qualities. The roof of the church was repaired with concrete in 1958. In addition, one can see modified cement work around the entrances to the church. The main entrance leads to the anteroom, 3.7m wide and 1.8m deep. A finely carved pillar comes into view in the anteroom, which is beautified by 15th-century murals, depicting angels and saints. The interior of the church is handsomely decorated with symmetrically patterned arches, columns and carvings. The ceiling is beautifully decorated although somewhat damaged and blackened by the fire of the 10th-century Queen Judith. There are thirteen freestanding and huge square pillars with cubical capitals supporting the 6-meter tall ceiling. There also exists a replica of the Ark of the Covenant. The existence of the church was first reported in England in 1868 by members of the Napier Expedition who visited it on their way to Maqdella. For many years, it was the only rock-hewn church known to the outside world, despite the fact that Portuguese Jesuit Father Manuel Barradas had already given an \"accurate\" account of the distribution of the rock-hewn churches of Gheralta and Hawzien."

Mrs. Dale Otto, who was a member of Pearce's pilgrimage to the rock-hewn churches, rightly described it as a \"miraculously hewn\" church. Abraha Atsebaha church is also decorated with splendid post-17th-century murals and paintings depicting Biblical scenes and saints. It also has several valuable treasures; the most important being the prayer cross which, according to church officials, belonged to Frumentius, the first Bishop of Ethiopia, whose ecclesiastical name was Abba Salama (Father of Peace). The church is dedicated to the famous twin Aksumite kings who introduced Christianity to Ethiopia in the 4th century. The bodies of Abraha and Atsbeha are believed to have been put to rest in the church. According to some archaeologists, the church is believed to have been built not earlier than the 10th century. Traditional thoughts, however, date it back to the 4th century. This great wonder is one of the highly revered churches of Ethiopia.

            "description": "It is a cave church situated east of a small village of Inda Teka Tesfay, 73 km along the Mekelle - Adigrat road. A ten-minute drive across the plain fields will bring you to this antiquity. The church lies on the cliff side of the escarpment, 2740m above sea level. It is visible from the main road because of its white-washed facade. The ascent of the cliff face is considered difficult and even terrifying. There are only finger holds and foot grips for use in the ascent. People who suffer from vertigo are advised not to try. After a visit to the church in January 1994, Caroline Swinburn of the BBC reported in one of their radio programs, \"This is not the relaxing country hike I have been led to expect. But rather the kind of expedition for which most westerners would normally take ropes and crampons and maybe even a full-scale mountain rescue team.\" The church is partly built (of wood, stone and mortar) and partly the cave. The Holy of Holies lies in the natural cave to the east of the small sanctuary. The sanctuary is square in shape, about 2m wide and 2m deep. There are two wooden pillars supporting the ceiling. Its murals are of great quality and pleasing artistry. On the walls and on the chamber antecedent to the Holy of Holies are a number of striking paintings depicting the Madonna and Child, Angels, the Nine Saints, Christ resurrecting, Adam and Eve, and many other subjects. The names of the Saints and Angels are shown on the murals. Saint Peter, Saint George, Abune Kiros, Abune Samuel, and others are shown in their finest robes and turbans. Paul Henze described the paintings as \"...among the most interesting early paintings I saw anywhere in Ethiopia.\" He went on to write that they \"...have an originality and liveliness often missing in Ethiopian paintings of this early period.\" Unfortunately, the wooden ceiling, mortar, and wood walls of the church that hold these magnificent murals and paintings are falling apart. The openings created as a result of the falling mortar have allowed dust and rainwater to wash away some of the paint. The church is no longer in use, apparently because of the difficulty in climbing the cliff. However, Halefom Retta, a peasant farmer in a neighboring village, has single-handedly hewn a replacement monolithic rock church right at the foot of the escarpment. The Petros and Paulos church is 10m wide, 9m deep, and about 3m from the floor to the ceiling. It has four freestanding pillars. The front part of the church is a constructed structure. The church is built in such a way that it could house three replicas of the Ark of the Covenant. Construction of the new Petros and Paulos began in 1982 and was completed twelve years later."

If one knows where to look, the two wooden doors are visible from the main road. One will find church bells of stone hanging in a tree just before reaching the churchyard. The two wooden doors of the church are oval shaped. The main entrance is so small that many must stoop to enter. It is about 1.5m tall and a little less than a meter wide. The church is believed to be a primitive cave. One can see the recent excavation works in what is now the Holy of Holies; four pillars (two of them freestanding) support the ceiling. The church is 5.5m wide and 7.6m deep, and the ceiling is 3m high. The most remarkable feature of the church is its beautifully decorated dome; it looks like a decorated circular \"Himbasha\" (local Tigrain bread). There is a Greek cross in the middle of the dome.

In the rock face, one can see potholes which the local people believe to be the footprints of Saint George and his horse. Just past the Deje Selam (Gate of Peace) one finds stone graves shaded by olive trees. The doors and windows of the church have massive, ornately carved wooden frames in Aksumite style. Paul Henze in his book Ethiopian Journeys writes, \"The doors and windows with their classic heavy wooden frames ornately decorated in Aksumite style were the most pleasing features of this church.\" The front part of the exterior is supported by four freestanding rectangular columns at intervals of about four meters. The intervals are filled with masonry. The roof of the church blends in with the hill out of which the church is carved. It was reported by Ivy Pearce, who visited the rock churches of Tigrai in the 1960s, that they resemble \"the thatched roofs of 15th-century English homes.\" At the top of the whitewashed exterior, there are three square windows decorated with Saint Andrew's crosses. Unlike its neighboring rock churches, Medhane Alem Adi Kesho has a cloister that runs from the north to the south end of the church and is beautifully decorated with patterns. Two doors lead to the sanctuary, where there are six huge square pillars supporting the ceiling, 10.20m wide and 10.35m deep. One can see a striking cross on the right side of the sanctuary's back wall, and its ceiling is delightfully and skillfully decorated with bas-relief and symmetrical patterns. Dale Otto reports, \"Because of the size and massive freestanding pillars, the church is decidedly Cathedral-like in its feeling, very majestic.\" There are no paintings whatsoever, but their absence is surely a blessing in disguise in the sense that their presence would have concealed the wonderfully hewn walls. According to Ruth Plant, Medhane Alem Adi Kesho is \"one of the truly great churches of the Tigrai.\" No academic authority has suggested a definite date of construction for the church. However, David Buxton, who regards the church as \"the earliest known attempt to copy a Debre-Damo type church in solid rock,\" hinted that the feasible period for the construction of the church is the late 10th or early 11th century, before Lalibela. Certainly, this edifice is one of the best rock-hewn churches of Tigrai in terms of architectural quality. It is a remarkable legacy in which we can see how advanced rock architecture was in Tigrai."
